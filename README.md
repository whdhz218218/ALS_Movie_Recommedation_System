# ALS_Movie_Recommedation_System

In this project, a movie recommendation system is built based on the MovieLens 265 M dataset. We used ALS method to predict userâ€™s movie rating so we can recommend movies to customers, which they potentially give high ratings according to prediction. Recommendation systems are used to provide personalized recommendations according to user profile and previous behavior. Recommender systems cannot only help the users find their favorite products, but also bring potential profit to online service providers.
